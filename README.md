## Approach

There are different ways to customize the elements into a WordPress page, such as using Visual Composer or Widgets. I have decided to make the things simple to the user while creating content, for example: he can create a simple 'New Page' and add a list (with an image and a text, where the strong text will be set as title), the CSS will be applied automatically in the 'Funcionalidades' section from Home Page.

# Notes

1. After install WordPress and Sage, and activate the theme I get this error: "Theme must be activated prior to using the customizer."

2. The Stage 9 version is unstable, then I installed the 8.5.1 version. The 9 version uses yarn and the 8.5.1 Gulp.
